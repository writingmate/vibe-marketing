## HUMAN VS AI CONTENT ASSESSMENT

### STEP 1: INITIAL CONTENT CREATION

### STEP 2: AI DETECTION ASSESSMENT

After completing the initial draft, evaluate the content for AI-generated indicators:

**Common AI Indicators to Identify:**

* Overly perfect structure and formulaic patterns

* Repetitive language and phrase patterns

* Generic, vague statements without specific details

* Lack of personal anecdotes or authentic voice

* Too formal or academic tone for the audience

* Consistent sentence lengths and paragraph structures

* Marketing-heavy language without substance

* Missing human imperfections and natural flow

**Assessment Questions:**

1. Does this sound like a real person sharing their experience?

2. Are there specific, authentic details that only someone with real experience would know?

3. Does the writing flow naturally with varied sentence structures?

4. Are there personal opinions, mistakes, or learning moments mentioned?

5. Does it avoid generic corporate language?

### STEP 3: HUMANIZATION UPDATES

Based on the assessment, implement these improvements:

**Add Personal Authenticity:**

* Include specific moments of frustration, surprise, or learning

* Mention real people, situations, or challenges faced

* Add parenthetical thoughts or tangential observations

* Include honest admissions of limitations or mistakes

* Reference specific timeframes, projects, or experiences

**Vary Structure and Style:**

* Break formulaic patterns between sections

* Mix short and long sentences naturally

* Add conversational asides and contractions

* Include rhetorical questions that feel natural

* Vary paragraph lengths and structures

**Inject Personality:**

* Add humor, skepticism, or genuine enthusiasm where appropriate

* Include opinion statements and personal preferences

* Reference pop culture, current events, or relatable analogies

* Add small tangents that show human thought patterns

* Include emotional reactions to tools or experiences

**Add Imperfections:**

* Mention tools that didn't work well or disappointed

* Include learning curves and initial difficulties

* Add corrections or updated thinking

* Reference changing opinions over time

* Include "by the way" or "speaking of which" transitions

### STEP 4: FINAL HUMAN-LIKE POLISH

Review the updated content for:

* Natural conversation flow

* Varied sentence and paragraph structures

* Specific, credible details

* Emotional authenticity

* Relatable human experiences
