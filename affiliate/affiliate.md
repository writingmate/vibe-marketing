## Deliverables

1. Completed registration for all affiliate programs
2. Spreadsheet tracking registration status, approval dates, and commission rates
3. All affiliate links organized by tool/article
4. Updated Framer website with affiliate links implemented
5. Final report documenting completed work and any pending items

## Progress Tracking

Create a status tracking sheet with the following columns:

- Tool name
- Registration status (Pending/Approved/Rejected)
- Registration date
- Approval date
- Commission rate
- Affiliate link
- Implementation status in Framer
- Assigned Agent (Agent 1, Agent 2, etc.)
- Notes

## Multi-Agent Coordination

Since multiple agents may work on this project simultaneously, each affiliate program should be assigned to a specific agent to avoid duplicate work. When working on an affiliate program:

1. Check the current status and assigned agent before starting work
2. Update the tracking sheet with your agent number when taking ownership
3. Mark your progress clearly to help other agents understand current status
4. Coordinate handoffs between agents when necessary

Agent assignments should be tracked in the "Assigned Agent" column of the status tracking sheet.
